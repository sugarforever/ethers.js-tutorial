## Instructions:

You are presented with a Next.js application that has a basic layout and a Context Provider. Your goal is to learn how to use the Metamask API to make this an application that users can interact with.

### 1 Basics: connecting the user

- Verify if the user has Metamask installed or not. If not, link to the Metamask website.
- If the user has Metamask installed, offer the user to connect their wallet

### 2. Novice: use the Metamask API to get information about the user

- Now that the user can connect, display the wallet address, balance of the wallet.

### 3. Intermediate: Two way communication with Metamask

- Listen to changes in the wallet address and balance and update the UI accordingly.
- Add an option to add a new token to the wallet.

### 4. Bonus/Advanced: UX goodies

- Persist the wallet address and balance in the local storage.
